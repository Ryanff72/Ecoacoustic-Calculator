---OLD REPO---
An R-Shiny App made for batch ecoacoustic calculation, by yours truly.

Much of the ecological sound analysis work that is done relies heavily on constantly tweaking the audio settings of R code in R Studio,
which is time consuming and requires technical knowledge. 

This project seeks to identify the utility of an R-Shiny App with the ability to aid researchers in calculating acoustic indices across
batches of data, with a fully customizable environment that seeks to make tweaking presets as accessible as possible without loss of the customization
that R Studio brings.

---UNDER CONSTRUCTION NOTE---
This project is in active development, and is not yet usable. This section will be updated in time!
